# üí• ‚ÄúWhy your code keeps breaking?‚Äù  
It‚Äôs probably not SOLID enough.

---

## ‚úÖ What is SOLID? (Explain like I‚Äôm 5)

üìò **SOLID = 5 rules to write better code**

- **S** ‚Üí Single Responsibility Principle  
- **O** ‚Üí Open/Closed Principle  
- **L** ‚Üí Liskov Substitution Principle  
- **I** ‚Üí Interface Segregation Principle  
- **D** ‚Üí Dependency Inversion Principle

They help your code stay clean, change-friendly, and testable üßº

## ‚úÖ What does it do & why it matters

‚ùå **Without SOLID**  
- Small changes break everything  
- Hard to test, scale, and debug  
- New devs avoid your code like a haunted house üëª

‚úÖ **With SOLID**  
- Each class has a clear purpose  
- You can add features without rewriting old code  
- Code becomes a team player ‚Äî not a time bomb üí£

---

## ‚úÖ Real-Life Analogy

üèóÔ∏è Imagine building a LEGO house  

- üß± **S**: Each block has one job (a door is just a door)  
- üß© **O**: Want to expand? Add more blocks, don‚Äôt touch old ones  
- üîÅ **L**: Replace a block with a similar one ‚Äî it still fits  
- üéöÔ∏è **I**: Don‚Äôt give all features to every block  
- üîå **D**: Use connectors ‚Äî not glue ‚Äî so things are swappable

üëâ **SOLID = Your code becomes modular, reusable, and fun to build.**

## ‚úÖ Java Code Examples

### S ‚Äî Single Responsibility Principle

```java
public class Invoice {
    public double calculateTotal() {
        // calculation logic
        return 0.0;
    }
}

public class InvoicePrinter {
    public void print(Invoice invoice) {
        // printing logic
    }
}
```

---

### O ‚Äî Open/Closed Principle

```java
public interface Discount {
    double apply(double price);
}

public class NewCustomerDiscount implements Discount {
    public double apply(double price) {
        return price * 0.90;
    }
}

public class BlackFridayDiscount implements Discount {
    public double apply(double price) {
        return price * 0.75;
    }
}
```

> Add new discount types without modifying existing ones ‚úÖ

---

### L ‚Äî Liskov Substitution Principle

```java
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Bird is flying");
    }
}

public class Sparrow extends Bird {}

public class Ostrich extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich can't fly!");
    }
}
```

‚ùå Violates Liskov ‚Äî Ostrich shouldn‚Äôt extend Bird if it can‚Äôt behave like one  
‚úÖ Fix: Create a `FlightBird` and `NonFlightBird` hierarchy instead

---

### I ‚Äî Interface Segregation Principle

```java
public interface Printer {
    void print();
}

public interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}

public class AllInOnePrinter implements Printer, Scanner {
    public void print() { /*...*/ }
    public void scan() { /*...*/ }
}

public class SimplePrinter implements Printer {
    public void print() { /*...*/ }
}
```

‚úÖ Don‚Äôt force classes to implement more than they need.

---

### D ‚Äî Dependency Inversion Principle

```java
public interface Keyboard {
    void type();
}

public class WiredKeyboard implements Keyboard {
    public void type() {
        System.out.println("Typing with wired keyboard");
    }
}

public class WirelessKeyboard implements Keyboard {
    public void type() {
        System.out.println("Typing with wireless keyboard");
    }
}

public class Computer {
    private final Keyboard keyboard;

    public Computer(Keyboard keyboard) {
        this.keyboard = keyboard;
    }

    public void typeSomething() {
        keyboard.type();
    }
}
```

‚úÖ High-level module `Computer` depends on abstraction `Keyboard`, not on concrete implementation.

## üß† Summary

**SOLID helps you build clean, flexible, bug-resistant code.**  
Each principle solves a real-world problem developers face when working with large systems.
